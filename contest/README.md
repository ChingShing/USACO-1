# USACO Bronze Solutions
## 2012
### November 2012
#### Problem 1: Find the Cow! `cowfind.cpp`
`*********t` 9/10 (timeout)

#### Problem 2: Typo `typo.cpp`
`******tttt` 6/10 (4 timeouts)

O(**N<sup>2</sup>**) is too slowâ€¦

#### Problem 3: Horseshoes `hshoe.cpp`
`**x***x***` 8/10 (2 wrong answers)

### December 2012
#### Problem 1: Meet and Greet `greetings.cpp`
`**********` 10/10 (perfect)

#### Problem 2: Scrambled Letters `scramble.cpp`
`*xxxxxtttt` 1/10 (5 wrong answers, 4 timeouts)

#### Problem 3: Crazy Fences `crazy.cpp`
`xsxssssssx` 0/10 (why were there signals?)

I have given up on this one. As a result, I just submitted code that will return C, in hopes that no boxes are formed by the fences for as many test cases as possible.

## 2013
### February 2013
#### Problem 1: Message Relay `relay.cpp`
`**********` 10/10 (perfect)

#### Problem 2: Cow Crossings `crossings.cpp`
`*xx*xxxxxxttttt` 2/15 (8 wrong answers, 5 timeouts)

I realized that I have made a mistake by not checking subsequent cows against cows that have already collided.

Example: Cow 1 collides with Cow 2, so they are both marked as collided. Cow 3 will not be checked against Cow 2.

#### Problem 3: Perimeter `perimeter.cpp`
`*xxxxxxxxx` 1/10 (9 wrong answers)

I found out that this solution is flawed because it doesn't "fill the holes" correctly. It fails when there are two adjacent hole cells.

### November 2013
#### Problem 1: Combination Lock `combo.cpp`
`*x*xxxx**x` 4/10 (6 wrong answers)

I optimized it near the end, but then I realized that the overlap() function fails when N < 5.

##### Correction `combo2.cpp`
`**********` 10/10 (perfect)

Upon review, I beat the solution! Although N is no larger than 100, my solution runs in O(1) time and theirs runs in O(N^3) time.

##### Correction 2 `combo3.cpp`
`**********` 10/10 (perfect)

This is more optimized than my previous correction though still in O(1) time.

#### Problem 2: Goldilocks and the N Cows `milktemp.cpp`
`*******ttt` 7/10 (3 timeouts)

I think that testing every boundary line might be slow, but it's the only way I can think of that does it completely.

#### Problem 3: Farmer John has no Large Brown Cow `nocow.cpp`
`**ssx*ssss` 3/10 (6 signals, 1 wrong answer)

I somehow ran out of memory and the permutations were not correct in one case.

### December 2013
#### Problem 1: Record Keeping `records.cpp`
`**********` 10/10 (perfect)

As long as there aren't any hash collisions, this is a fast solution.

#### Problem 2: Cow Baseball `baseball.cpp`
`*xxxxxxxxx` 1/10 (9 wrong answers)

O(**N<sup>2</sup> log N**) time might be too slow.

#### Problem 3: Wormholes `wormhole.cpp`
(`incomplete`)

It's too difficult, but I had it partially done. Other partial work is in the recycling by now.

## 2014
### January 2014
#### Problem 1: Ski Course Design `skidesign.cpp`
`**********` 10/10

My solution is O(**N<sup>2</sup>**), but up to 83*99 iterations.

#### Problem 2: Bessie Slows Down `slowdown.cpp`
`*xxxxxxxxx` 1/10 (9 wrong answers)

My solution is O(**N log N**), but I somehow made an error somewhere (probably rounding errors).

#### Problem 3: Balanced Teams `bteams.cpp`
(`incomplete`)

It's too difficult, so I give up.

### February 2014
#### Problem 1: Mirror Field `mirror.cpp`
(`unknown`)

This is actually more difficult than Problem 2, which I completed first.

#### Problem 2: Auto-complete `auto.cpp`
(`unknown`)

Just sort the entries, but also store the original position, then process the requests.

#### Problem 3: Secret Code `scode.cpp`
(`unknown`)

This one took more time than Problem 1 and Problem 2, but at least I actually finished this Problem 3, unlike the last few ones.
